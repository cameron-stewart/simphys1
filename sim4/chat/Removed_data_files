Hi Cameron,

I removed the documentation directory and all the dat and fig directories from git. 
	git rm --cached -r dat.

I think it will be necessary to add the new data-files to git because we will need the graphics for the report and when we produce random data, we cannot make a copy by running the program again. We can delete it after finishing of the task.

What do you think is necessary to add to the git repository and what not?
