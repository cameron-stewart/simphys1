Hi Cameron

I created this folder for giving deeper insights in the others work. 
It will be easier to put information about what you have done in a txt file than explain it in the commit message or whatsapp.

I expanded the ljsim.py for the --time <simtime> command-line option.
It works analougus to the --cont <simtime>

I expanded the ljsim.py for computing the temperature directly and to get the pressure from c.
I did this because the temperature is a scalar multiplication and dividion, but the pressure has to be calculated from vectors like the force.
Therefore I replaced sum(m*v^2) through 2*E_kin in order to save runtime.
I interpreted the direction of the force fij as -fij because otherwise the pressure will become negative in about 50% of the cases.
At least I interpreted the mass m as 1.
